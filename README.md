## Introduction

You know 

 - Most note-taking apps arenâ€™t designed with programmers in mind
 - they can be so difficult to use that they drive you to give up on   
   notes entirely.
 - Taking notes should not be difficult and time consuming. Should be
   easy and simple

## Usage

#### Import

There are a few different ways to import code into Carbon:

- Drop a file onto the editor
- Append a GitHub gist id to the url (e.g. `carbon.now.sh/GIST_ID_HERE`)
- Paste your code directly

#### Customization

Once you've got all of your code into Carbon, you can customize your image by changing the syntax theme, background color, window theme, or padding.

#### Export/Sharing

After you've customized your image you can either Tweet a link to the image, or save it directly.

If you include a Carbon image in a post, the source code will be invisible for assistive technology, it will not be possible to enlarge it or copy it, etc. Please, think about adding another element with the source code as text, like an [HTML Details Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) below the image.
